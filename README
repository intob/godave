Dave is an open protocol, designed to simply & efficiently distribute a hash
table in a byzantine environment. A peer-to-peer cache, anonymised, and
almost instantly-consistent. Clients (webapps included, via HTTP gateway),
may write to the network without any token or key, providing only a classic
hashcash style proof-of-work. Packets with fields value, time, and a time-
bound proof-of-work (nonce, work) are gossiped, until their weight has decayed
such that they are no-longer available on any node.


1.      Constants

MTU             1500            Reasonable value to avoid packet
                                fragmentation.
NPEER           2               Limit to prevent Eclipse attack.
EPOCH           26544358ns      Base minimum period of the operation cycle.
DELAY           512             Epochs until dats are shared to new peers.
SHARE           8               Epochs until silent peers are no-longer
                                advertised.
PING            64              Epochs until silent peers are pinged. 
DROP            512             Epochs until silent peers are dropped from the
                                peer table.
PRUNE           128             Number of epochs between dat pruning.
SEEDSEED        1024            For seed nodes. Number of epochs between
                                sending a random dat. Seed nodes must already
                                send many PEER messages, but also help to
                                seed.


2.      User-configurable Settings

                SUGGESTED VALUE
FILTER_CAP      1M      Allocates around 1MB. Should be increased to 2, 4 or
                        8M if possible.
DAT_CAP         1M      As large as possible for available memory. ~1304B per
                        dat.


2.      Operation Codes

GETPEER         Packet requesting that the remote replies with NPEER random
                peer descriptors.
PEER            Packet containing NPEER peer descriptors.
DAT             Packet containing a value, time, and output of the
                cost function: work, nonce.


3.      Message

3. 1.   Message Fields

                DESCRIPTION                             BYTE LENGTH
Op              Operation code.                         1
Peers           List of peers who forwarded.            20*DISTANCE
Work            SHA256(SHA256(Val, Time), Nonce).       0 | 32
Nonce           Work salt.                              0 | 32
Time            Approximate time. Packets with a        0 | 8
                future time are dropped.
Val             The data.                               <= 1200 for MTU=1500,
                                                        DISTANCE=7

3. 2.   Wire Format

A message is serialized into binary using protobuf. See protobuf spec
dave.proto.

Transpiling Protobuf Spec for Go:
#!/bin/bash
protoc --go_out=. dave.proto


4.      Peer Discovery & Liveness

The protocol ensures a cohesive network by combining liveness and peer
discovery into a single pair of direct messages (GETPEER & PEER). A node
replies to a GETPEER message with a PEER message with up to NPEER peer
descriptors. Peers are not advertised if they have not been seen recently.


5.      DAT

DAT is a construct representing a value, 8B timestamp, 32B nonce,
and 32B proof-of-work. The proof-of-work allows the network to prioritise
storage of newer keys backed by more work, and prevent spam/flooding.


5.      Weight

weight = difficulty * (1 / ageMilliseconds)

Where difficulty is number of leading zero bytes, age is calculated from the
time.


5. 2.   Replacement by Weight

Once per PRUNE epochs, a user defined number of heaviest DATs persisted,
and the remaining are dropped.


6.      Send One Random DAT

Every EPOCH, each node sends one random DAT to one random peer. This
ensures reliable distribution and sender anonymitiy.

Propagating DATs in this way ensures that an adversary is unable to
create a timing-attack to discern the source of a DAT, even with a broad
view of network traffic.

6.      GET Message

If the receiver has the dat, the receiver replies to the remote with a DAT
message.


7.      Packet Filter

Dropping packets efficiently is fundamental to resilience against DoS attack.

Cuckoo filters leverage cuckoo hashing to efficiently store fingerprints in a
compact hash table, enabling fast insertions, deletions and lookups. This
makes them well-suited for performance-critical applications like packet
filtering to improve DoS attack resilience.

Packets that deviate from the protocol are detected & dropped without
further processing.

The key inserted uniquely into the cuckoo filter:
        
FNV128A(REMOTE_IP, HASH4(PORT), OP_CODE)

Failing unique insertion, the packet is dropped.

The cuckoo filter is reset every epoch, therefore each OP_CODE may be sent
once per IP-PORT per epoch. The number of ports allowed per IP address is
limited using a 4-bit multiply-then-shift hash function.


8.      Usage
This repository contains three go modules. First, godave is the protocol
implementation in library form. Second, daved is a command-line application,
it makes the library executable as a node. daved also allows basic interaction
with the network directly.

When daved is started without arguments, the default mode of operation is as a
node, participating in the network. It will listen for dats, as they are
gossipped randomly through the network, relaying them as in the protocol spec.

Arguments followed by default values:
-s                      Start as seed node. Off by default.
-l [::]:0               Listen ip address and port (listen on everything,
                        random available port)
-b :1992                Bootstrap to port (local machine inferred)
-b 3.255.246.69:1618    Bootstrap to ip:port
-d 2                    Difficulty of poof-of-work when using set command.
-dcap 500000            Capacity of dat map held in memory.
-fcap 1000000           Capacity of cuckoo filter.
-v                      Verbose logging, grep by log path prefix.
