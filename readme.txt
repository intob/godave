Simple DHT based on proof-of-work to pay for storage.

Pay with work to store bytes.

The reward for storing a key is proportional to the work backing the data.

When a node runs out of storage, it must select a subset.

A node is incentivised to store the keys backed by the most work.

Stake in the network is ammount of work in the hash table.

Nodes check each-other at random and gossip the proofs of storage.

We can reserve some namespace in the DHT for network operation.
